Privacy Policy for Misfit

Last Updated: 2026-01-13

1. Introduction

Welcome to Misfit ("the App"). This App is built on the Reddit Developer Platform (Devvit). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. By playing Misfit, you consent to the practices described in this policy. 2. Information We Collect

To provide game functionality, save your progress, and manage leaderboards, we collect the following limited data points:
A. Reddit Account Information

- Reddit User ID: We collect your unique, immutable Reddit ID (e.g., t2_xxxxx). This is used as a secure "key" to identify your save file in our database.

- Reddit Username: We access your public Reddit username (e.g., u/YourName) for display purposes on the leaderboard.

B. Game Data

- Gameplay Statistics: Your results, ranking, and clues you have given

- Settings Preferences: Including your choice of "Display Name" (see Section 4).

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following specific purposes:

- Save States: To store your progress so you can resume playing later.

- Leaderboards: To display high scores and rankings to the public.

- API Communication: We use Reddit's http-fetch capability to transmit your User ID and Game Data to our external API for secure storage and processing.

4. Leaderboards and Privacy Controls

By default, the App displays your Reddit Username on the global leaderboard if you achieve a high score.

Your Privacy Options: We understand that some users prefer anonymity. The App includes an in-game Settings Menu where you can create a custom "Display Name".

- If you set a custom Display Name, we will display that name on the leaderboard instead of your Reddit Username.

- Your Reddit User ID is still used internally to track your score, but it is never exposed to the public.

5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

- External Database: Your game data is stored on a third-party server managed by the developer strictly for the purpose of maintaining game functionality.

- Legal Compliance: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws.

6. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your game data for as long as you are an active player of the App.

Right to be Forgotten: If you wish to have your data permanently deleted from our servers, please contact us at adam.spanel@seznam.cz.

- Upon receiving a request, we will delete all data associated with your Reddit User ID within 30 days.

7. Children's Privacy

This App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. 9. Contact Us
